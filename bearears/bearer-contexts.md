# Bearer Contexts

**GTP Bearer Contexts**

A GTP (GPRS Tunneling Protocol) Bearer Context refers to the logical path created for user data transfer between the User Equipment (UE) and the network in mobile telecommunications.&#x20;

Each bearer context is defined by a unique set of Quality of Service (QoS) parameters and characteristics to ensure proper delivery of services according to user or application needs.

**Key Features:**

* **Unique Identification**: Each GTP bearer is identified by the Tunnel Endpoint Identifier (TEID), along with the IP addresses of the GTP peers.
* **QoS Parameters**: Includes attributes such as priority, data rate, and delay tolerance, ensuring that data packets meet specific service requirements.
* **Creation and Management**: Bearers are dynamically created, modified, and deleted in response to network conditions and user activity.
* **Separation of Control and User Plane**: Facilitates efficient data routing and avoids congestion by keeping signaling and data transfer independent.

GTP Bearer Contexts are essential for maintaining a reliable and efficient data connection in 2G, 3G, and 4G networks.
