# GTP Bearer

A GTP (GPRS Tunneling Protocol) Bearer is a communication channel used in mobile networks to provide data connectivity between user equipment and packet data networks.&#x20;

It serves to encapsulate and transport IP packets over the mobile backhaul, ensuring a seamless data flow through the core network.&#x20;

The GTP Bearer comprises both the user data and the bearer signaling, facilitating the management of QoS (Quality of Service) parameters, allocating network resources, and maintaining efficient data transmission.
