# ðŸŸ¢ GTP-C (Control)

**GTP-C (GPRS Tunneling Protocol - Control Plane)** is a protocol used for signaling within the GPRS core network. It facilitates the control signaling for creating, modifying, and deleting tunnels.&#x20;

The GTP-C protocol is responsible for functions such as session and mobility management, routing information exchange, and error handling.&#x20;

It operates over UDP, typically using port 2123, and is essential for effective packet data transfer in mobile networks.

#### Key Features of GTP-C

* **Session Management**: GTP-C plays a crucial role in initiating and managing user sessions, and handling parameters necessary for establishing data bearer contexts.
* **Mobility Management**: Supports mobility by facilitating seamless handovers, ensuring ongoing data sessions are maintained without interruption when a user moves across cells or network regions.
* **Routing Information**: Efficiently exchanges necessary routing information between network nodes, ensuring correct delivery paths for user data packets.
* **Error Handling**: Implements robust error detection and correction mechanisms to ensure reliable communication and data integrity.

#### Protocol Operations

GTP-C messages are exchanged between GPRS network nodes, such as SGSNs (Serving GPRS Support Nodes) and GGSNs (Gateway GPRS Support Nodes).&#x20;

These operations are integral to the management of the network's dynamic connections and resources, ensuring optimal network performance and user experience.
